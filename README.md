# Farstar 2  
  
For the original game, see [Farstar: Exodus](https://github.com/Dark-Gran/Farstar-Exodus).  
  
## About Project  
  
I've always enjoyed card games (both collectible and "classic"), so after an attempt to merge them with a strategy genre, I decided to make a game that actually fits the "card game" description.  
  
With that in mind (and with feedback in hands), game's rules have been _drastically_ changed, therefore the entire application is being 'rewritten' from the scratch.  
  
This time in Java. One of the main reasons to pick Adobe Air (in which the original game is written) is the fact that it is cross-platform, however such is the case with Java as well. For applications of this size, Java is also a more lightweight (performance-wise) solution.  
  
**Current goal of this project is to create an 'offline version' of the original game.**  
  
Server Application with user registrations, matchmaking and card-trading (all features of the original game) would be added in case of a positive reception.  

Currently the prototype is only in internal testing.
